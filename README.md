# Transgene

This code was prepared in MATLAB 2019a with full packages, and tested on Windows 8.

This code serves to calculate the pulsation and deformation on zebrafish embryos in 2D images. YC Ding incorporated the multi-threshold segmentation, PCA analysis and quantitative analysis to efficiently extract the principal directions and calculate the deform in 2D time-lapse images. This new version incorporates a group of fixed PCA axes, allowing for segmentation, division and quantification from end-systole to end-diastole, bypassing the registration between two conditons.
